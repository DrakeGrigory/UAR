# UAR  
Project for an Automatic Control System using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming.

## What is this project?  
This project is a refactored version of an earlier project ("LAB_PO") that I worked on during the first semester of my Master's degree in ASIC Verification and Design.

### LAB_PO  
The goal of the LAB_PO project was to learn the basics of Object-Oriented Programming: polymorphism, design patterns, inheritance, etc.

The original LAB_PO project has several flaws that I intend to address:
- Mixed Polish-English comments and variable names  
- Improper use of certain C++ features  
- Lack of optimization in serialization/deserialization  
- Poor or missing documentation  
- And more...

LAB_PO consists of 21 `.h` and `.cpp` files, along with 8 deserialization examples.

### UAR  
The UAR project focuses on fixing the above issues and refactoring the code.  
The updated code will be uploaded to this repository incrementally, starting with `ObjectSISO`, `ModelARX`, `RegulatorPID`, and so on.
